 -[Model Building](#ModelBuilding)
 -[Model Training and Evaluation](#ModelTrainingandEvaluation)

## Environment Setup
- You have downloaded and used a set of important libraries and frameworks for data analysis and machine learning.

## Data Loading and Analysis
- You have loaded the Iris flower data and displayed it to check the structure and basic characteristics of the data.
- You have understood the data using commands such as describing the basic statistics and plotting the graphs.

## Model Building
- You have defined the goal of the project, which is to predict the types of diseases that Iris flowers face.
- You have split the data into training and validation sets with an 80:20 ratio.
- You have chosen to use the KNeighborsClassifier model from the scikit-learn library for classification.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- You have trained the model using the training data and evaluated it on the independent data set.
- You have achieved a classification accuracy of 86.66%, which is a good performance for the model.
